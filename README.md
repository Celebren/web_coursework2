Expanding on the previous repository, all the files are converted into .php files. The forms are funcitonal and new users can register to the SQL database or log in to the site. An administrator can log in to view the list of registered users and has the ability to remove entries in the database directly from the web page. Logging in to the site creates a new session with the name of the logged in user and logging out terminates the session. Admin and user details pages are only accessible if an active session exists. 

### To run
A server and databse are required to run the site.  
Databse details in connect.php:  
```
server = 'localhost'     
username = 'root'  
password = ''  
database = '40321603'  
```
